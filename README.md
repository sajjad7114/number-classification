# number-classification
Here I used sklearn to classify handwritten numbers 2, 3, and 7 by soft margin linear SVM and soft margin kernel SVM with gaussian kernel, in one vs. one and one vs. all approach.
For linear SVM I got C=1 as the optimal C and the same test error (about 0.046) for both one vs. one and one vs. all approachs.
For gaussian SVN I got C=1 and gamma=0.01 as the best parameters and the same test error (about 0.66) for both one vs. one and one vs. all approachs.
